** DNS SERVER SETTINGS AND SERVER INFORMATION **
---------------------------------------------------------------------
If you have requested a domain name during sign up, please keep in mind that your domain name will not be visible on the internet instantly. This process is called propagation and can take up to 48 hours. Until your domain has propagated, your website and email will not function, we have provided a temporary ftp host which you can use to upload your site. You can also preview your site via the control panel, however, scripts and flash content may not work via the preview mode.
If you are using an existing domain with your new hosting account, you will need to update the nameservers to point to the nameservers listed below.
Nameserver 1: ns30.hostingmadeeasy.com (72.249.151.136)
Nameserver 2: ns31.hostingmadeeasy.com (72.249.151.46)
 
Your account is hosted on Dell's next-generation Intel® Xeon® processor-based PowerEdge Rack Servers hostname and ip of which are given below;
Server Name: oxygen.hostingmadeeasy.com
Server IP: 72.249.151.136
Webpage URL: http://www.myeoman.com
---------------------------------------------------------------------
** UPLOADING YOUR SITE **
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Until your domain name is registered or transferred, you can use the following temporary ftp host to upload your website.
Temporary FTP Hostname: 72.249.151.136
Please use your favorite FTP software (we recommend FileZilla) to upload your files to your website. Point your FTP software to your IP for now and when your domain is active, you can use your domain name as the host name. It is always best just to use your IP address as the hostname when connecting to your account via FTP.
You can also preview your site via the control panel, however, scripts and flash content may not work via the preview mode.
 
Once your domain has propagated you may use the details below:
FTP Hostname: www.myeoman.com
Files viewable by public should be uploaded to the www folder. Files uploaded in folders under www will not be publically viewable.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
** E-MAIL SETUP INFORMATION **
---------------------------------------------------------------------
E-mail services are also now available on your account. In order to have a smooth transition without any loss of e-mail, be sure to setup any existing POP3 e-mail accounts you currently maintain. Once your domain name transfers to our service, any e-mail in transit will be sent to your account on our servers. Therefore, it is important that you get your e-mail settings configured properly right away.
Below are the settings you should use for your e-mail client:
POP3 Host Address: mail.myeoman.com
SMTP Host Address: mail.myeoman.com
Username: The email address you are checking email for
Password: As specified in your control panel
Webmail : http://webmail.myeoman.com
You will need to enable outgoing mail server authentication in your email client before sending outgoing mail. This is to avoid non-clients from using our mail servers for spam (unsolicited e-mail), which we forbid. If you need help with this, do not hesitate to contact our support department.
